Ribosomal proteins-based Phylogenetic tree to represent all known bacteria

As part of my studies toward an MSc in Computational Biology at Tel-Aviv university, I had the need for an all-known bacteria phylogenetic tree.
This tree, later, will serve me as a visualization skeleton, upon it and with respect to it, all of my bacteria-specific study results and insights will be mounted and shown.
